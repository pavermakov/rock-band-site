# A Rock-Band Website

This is my senior project that I have developed to conclude my Computer Science major at the American University in Bulgaria. 

I have chosen to develop a website for this particular band, because I personally know one of its members. Therefore, I thought I would be an extra motivation for me. I wanted to develop a soft of a hub for the fans to hang out, view band's updates, listen to the favorite songs and even purchase merchandise items.
